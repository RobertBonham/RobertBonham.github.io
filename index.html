			  <li>The blue and black color scheme is clean and simple.</li>
			  <li>The image links for various projects are busy with text laid over the image.</li>
			  <li>The headings are formatted with a search bar and navigation links, and is the 
			  same for each page. </li>
			  <li>The logo is a link back to the home page. </li>
